## Problem with credentials

As I initiated integration tests for my API, I initially possessed a .env-dev file but realized the absence of a .env-tests file. Promptly, I created the file, populated it with essential data, executed the tests, and seemingly committed the changes, assuming all was well. It was only during the push to the origin that the gravity of my oversight dawned on meâ€”I had neglected to include .env-tests in the .gitignore, inadvertently exposing sensitive credentials in the commit history.

Faced with this predicament, I felt at a loss until I delved into potential solutions and discovered the BFG Repo-Cleaner. This tool became my salvation; it enabled me to retrospectively alter the commit history, rectifying the inadvertent exposure of credentials. This experience served as a valuable lesson, impressing upon me the importance of meticulous version control practices.

Moving forward, I've gained a profound understanding from this mistake. Should a similar scenario arise in a production environment, I am now equipped with the knowledge to calmly and effectively address such issues, ensuring the security and integrity of sensitive information.

### How did I solve this problem

1 - I downloaded the .jar file from [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) and placed it in the same folder as the project

2 - I deleted the file that had the commit history credentials with the command:

```bash
  java -jar bfg-1.14.0.jar --delete-files env-tests.properties
```

3 - I ran this command that is in the BFG documentation:

```bash
  git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```

4 - and finally I was able to upload to the origin without the leaked credentials

```bash
  git push
```
